I used a youtube tutorial for this project and then added some additional features to it

the tutorial i used: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki0XXrlKlHY

The added features:
   - rotated the numbers so for example as my grandmother pointed out to me the 6 looks like a 9
        it is fixed.
    
    -got new colors
    -it shows the year it shows the day int the week like Thursday also the number of days in a month 
        like 22.
    and it also shows the months around the clock and the current month is marked with a different letter

    -I made it responsive- but I see now it's not perfect, when I am gonna have time I am gonna look 
    into it
